# UART-Serial-Communication
"Implementation of a UART (Universal Asynchronous Receiver/Transmitter) module in Verilog, designed for serial communication between devices. The project includes a testbench for simulation and verification of the UART functionality, with support for 9600 baud rate and transmission/reception of 8-bit data."
